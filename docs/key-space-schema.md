# Key-Space Schema

MuninnDB stores all state in a single Pebble instance using a prefix-partitioned key space. Each prefix byte (0x01–0x24) identifies a distinct data type, and keys are constructed by dedicated functions in the `storage` package — never assembled ad hoc. Most prefixes are vault-scoped: the key begins with a workspace prefix (`wsPrefix`) derived from a SipHash of the vault name. A handful of prefixes are global (cross-vault) and omit the workspace prefix entirely.

This document is the authoritative reference for every prefix in the system. Update it before merging any change that introduces or modifies a key layout.

## Key Scoping Model

**Vault-scoped keys** follow the pattern: `prefix(1) | wsPrefix(8) | ...payload`. The `wsPrefix` is an 8-byte SipHash of the vault name, providing constant-size namespace isolation without embedding variable-length vault names in every key.

**Global keys** follow the pattern: `prefix(1) | ...payload`. These store data that spans vaults (the entity registry, idempotency receipts, vault name index, digest flags).

**Cross-vault keys** are a special case of global keys where the payload includes a `wsPrefix` as a data field (not a namespace prefix). The entity reverse index (0x23) uses this pattern to map entities back to engrams across vaults.

## Layer-by-Layer Deep Dive

### Engram and Metadata Layer (0x01, 0x02, 0x18)

The foundational layer. Every piece of knowledge in MuninnDB is an engram — a self-contained record encoded in ERF v2 format (0x01) with a fixed-size metadata sidecar (0x02). The quantized embedding (0x18) stores a compressed vector representation separately from the engram body, allowing similarity search without deserializing the full record. Engram and metadata keys are always written together in the same Pebble batch.

### Association Layer (0x03, 0x04, 0x14)

Weighted, directed edges between engrams. The forward index (0x03) stores edges sorted by weight descending using complement encoding — a Pebble prefix scan from any source engram yields its strongest associations first. The reverse index (0x04) enables incoming-edge queries. The weight lookup key (0x14) provides O(1) access to a specific edge's weight without scanning. All three are written atomically in `WriteAssociation`.

### Full-Text Search Layer (0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x1B)

A self-contained FTS engine built on Pebble primitives. Posting lists (0x05) map terms to engram IDs. Trigram indexes (0x06) support fuzzy and substring queries. HNSW neighbor lists (0x07) back the approximate nearest-neighbor graph for vector search. Global stats (0x08) and per-term stats (0x09) feed BM25 scoring. The schema version marker (0x1B) gates FTS migrations.

### Entity Graph Layer (0x1F, 0x20, 0x21, 0x23, 0x24)

Added in the entity extraction pipeline. Entities are globally registered (0x1F) with confidence-preserving merge semantics — if two vaults extract the same entity, the higher confidence wins. Forward links (0x20) and reverse links (0x23) connect engrams to entities bidirectionally and are always written as an atomic pair. Relationship records (0x21) capture typed relations (manages, depends_on, contradicts, etc.) between entity pairs scoped to a source engram. Co-occurrence counts (0x24) track how often two entities appear together, using canonically ordered hash pairs to avoid duplicates.

### Secondary Index Layer (0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x10, 0x22)

Derived indexes that accelerate filtered queries. Each maps a single attribute (lifecycle state, tag, creator, relevance score, contradiction relationship) to the set of engram IDs matching that value. These are always rebuildable from engram metadata — they are optimization structures, not source-of-truth data. The relevance bucket index (0x10) uses inverted bucket values so a forward Pebble scan returns the highest-relevance engrams first.

### Configuration and Metadata (0x0E, 0x0F, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x15, 0x17, 0x19, 0x1D)

Singleton or low-cardinality keys that store per-vault configuration (vault name, scoring weights, migration versions, embedding model marker, coherence counter) and global operational state (vault name index, digest flags, idempotency receipts). The vault engram count (0x15) is the only key in this group that uses `pebble.Sync` — it enforces storage quotas and must survive crashes to prevent over-allocation.

### Structural Layer (0x16, 0x1A, 0x1C, 0x1E)

Keys that encode temporal and structural relationships. Provenance entries (0x16) form an append-only audit log keyed by engram ID, nanosecond timestamp, and sequence number. Episodes (0x1A) group related engrams into sessions; episode frames use a 0xFF separator byte and are synced atomically with their frame count. PAS transitions (0x1C) record state-machine edges. Ordinals (0x1E) define parent→child ordering and are Sync-tier because ordering correctness is critical.

## Atomicity Guarantees

Several key groups are always written in the same Pebble `Batch` to maintain cross-prefix consistency:

| Keys | Operation | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| 0x01 + 0x02 | `WriteEngram` | Engram body and metadata are never out of sync. |
| 0x20 + 0x23 | `WriteEntityEngramLink` | Forward and reverse entity links are never orphaned. |
| 0x03 + 0x04 + 0x14 | `WriteAssociation` | All three association indexes reflect the same edge state. |
| 0x1A frame + 0x1A FrameCount | `AppendFrame` | Frame content and the episode's frame counter advance atomically. Uses `pebble.Sync`. |

---

## Caching Strategy

| Prefix | Cache | Scope | Eviction | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x01 (Engram) | L1 engram cache | Per-vault | Size-based | Pessimistic — cache entry is evicted *before* the write reaches Pebble. Prevents stale reads on write-path failures. |
| 0x02 (Metadata) | metaCache | Global, keyed by ULID | Size-based | Manual — callers explicitly invalidate after mutation. |
| 0x03 (Assoc Forward) | assocCache | Global | TTL-based | Stale reads are acceptable for traversal workloads. Returns copies (copy-on-return) to prevent caller mutation of cached data. |

All other prefixes are read directly from Pebble with no application-level cache. Pebble's own block cache provides transparent read acceleration for hot keys.

---

## Relationship Type Bytes

The entity relationship prefix (0x21) encodes the relationship type as a single byte in the key. The mapping is fixed and must not be reordered — existing data on disk depends on these values.

| Byte | Relationship Type |
|---|---|
| 0x01 | manages |
| 0x02 | uses |
| 0x03 | depends_on |
| 0x04 | implements |
| 0x05 | created_by |
| 0x06 | part_of |
| 0x07 | causes |
| 0x08 | contradicts |
| 0x09 | supports |
| 0x0A | co_occurs_with |
| 0x0B | caches_with |
| 0xFF | unknown |

## Rules for Adding a New Key Space

1. **Pick a prefix byte.** Choose the next unused byte. Check this document and `grep` for existing `keyPrefix` constants in the `storage` package. Never reuse a prefix, even if the old one was "removed" — data may still exist on disk.

2. **Document it here.** Add a row to the Complete Prefix Table and a description in the appropriate layer section before the code review.

3. **Implement a key construction function.** All key assembly lives in the `storage` package (typically `keys.go`). Never build keys with raw byte concatenation outside that package.

4. **Choose a durability tier.** Default to `pebble.NoSync` unless the data is a source of truth that cannot be re-derived. If you choose `pebble.Sync`, document why in the code and add it to `docs/durability-guarantees.md`.

5. **Define atomicity requirements.** If this key must be written atomically with other prefixes, use a single `pebble.Batch` and document the batch group in the Atomicity Guarantees section above.

6. **Consider caching.** If the key will be read on hot paths, evaluate whether an application-level cache is warranted. Document the invalidation strategy.

7. **Write a migration if needed.** If existing databases need to be backfilled, add a numbered migration in the `migrations` package and bump the migration version. The migration must be idempotent.

8. **Test the key layout.** Write a test that round-trips key construction and extraction. Verify sort order if the key encodes ordered fields (weights, timestamps, bucket values).
