## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Dashboard activity panel overhaul: selectable timeframe presets (7d–180d, capped at 180 days), end-date picker, dynamic x-axis tick grouping based on chart width, and a raw data table toggle with copy-to-clipboard. Includes loading, error, and empty-state feedback.
- `GET /api/activity-counts` endpoint returning per-day engram creation counts for a vault. Accepts `days` (1–180, default 7) and optional `until` (YYYY-MM-DD) query parameters. Malformed or out-of-range values return 400. Backed by an efficient ULID key-header scan with zero-filled contiguous day ranges.

### Changed
- Public vault unauthenticated access now runs in `full` mode. Previously, requests to an open vault with no API key ran as `observe`, silently preventing cognitive-state writes. Public vaults are now genuinely open — callers get `full` access unless they present an explicit `observe` key.

### Fixed
- Enrich now accepts OpenAI-compatible JSON responses returned in `message.reasoning` when `message.content` is empty, including structured reasoning payloads.
- Retry and retroactive enrichment now only mark entity and relationship stages complete after successful persistence, avoiding partial-state retries, nil-result crashes, and silent graph-write failures.
- Entity and relationship response parsing now rejects nested wrapper keys like `meta.entities` / `meta.relationships` instead of treating them as valid empty results.
- Vault-scoped REST routes now resolve non-default vaults consistently from authenticated request bodies as well as `?vault=`, and reject mismatched query/body vaults.
- Vault-scoped REST routes are setup to deprecate vault passed in the body in a later release.
- REST read responses now include `memory_type: 0` for fact-classified memories instead of omitting the field.
- Observe-mode API keys now return `403` on semantically mutating REST and gRPC routes while preserving access to read-like POST endpoints such as activation, traversal, explanation, and batch link reads.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Native TLS support via `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` flags on all 5 client-facing servers
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec served at `GET /api/openapi.yaml` (60+ routes documented)

- Query timeout enforcement — 30s activation deadline with BFS short-circuit (`MUNINN_ACTIVATE_TIMEOUT`)
- Automated backup scheduler (`--backup-interval`, `--backup-dir`, `--backup-retain`)
- Vault rename — metadata-only rename across storage, engine, REST, CLI, and Web UI
- Contradiction resolution — Keep A, Keep B, Merge, Dismiss actions in Web UI
- CLI: `muninn vault create`, `muninn api-key create|list|revoke`, `muninn admin change-password`
- Web UI: engram edit/evolve, new vault creation, manual link/association creation
- Web UI: vault export/import, FTS reindex, lifecycle state transitions
- Web UI: explain scores ("Why?" button), consolidate, record decision modals
- Web UI: memory filtering and sorting (created/accessed, tags, state, confidence, date range)
- Web UI: keyboard shortcuts (`/` search, `n` new, `?` help), tooltips, prev/next navigation
- Web UI: per-engram embedding status indicator, API key expiry column, backup trigger
- Graph: orphan node filtering, zoom controls (+/−/Fit)
- Observability tab in Web UI with live polling
- `GET /api/admin/observability` REST endpoint with full system snapshot
- Per-vault latency tracker with percentile reporting (p50/p95/p99)
- Vault-labeled Prometheus histograms for write/activate/read latency
- `vault reembed` command (CLI, REST, Web UI)
- CHANGELOG.md, encryption at rest documentation, CI OpenAPI spec validation
- PR template with release checklist, hookify drift detection rules
- Branch protection on main (PR + approval + CI) and develop (CI)
- Node SDK publish workflow (OIDC trusted publishing)
- Patent notice (U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/991,402)

### Fixed
- ListEngrams now uses passive Pebble scan — no Hebbian side effects on browse
- Explain runs in observe mode — no cognitive mutations on "Why?" clicks
- Session click fetches full engram data + updates URL hash
- Atomic auth config rename (Pebble batch instead of separate Set+Delete)
- Sentinel error `ErrVaultNameCollision` replaces fragile string matching across clone/import/rename
- `parseKeyExpiry` rejects past dates at creation time
- Backup test data race (atomic counter for stubCheckpointer)
- Windowed average calculation in latency tracker
- Unconditional Prometheus metric recording and reembed vault response handling
- MCP vault default fix
