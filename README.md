# MuninnDB

**Memory that strengthens with use, fades when unused, and pushes to you when it matters** — accessible over MCP, REST, gRPC, or SDK.

*Provisional patent filed Feb 26, 2026 on the core cognitive primitives (engine-native Ebbinghaus decay, Hebbian learning, Bayesian confidence, semantic triggers). This helps protect the project so we can keep it open and innovative for everyone.*

## Try It — 30 Seconds

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
# 1. Install
curl -sSL https://muninndb.com/install.sh | sh

# 2. Start (first-run setup is automatic)
muninn start
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# 1. Install
irm https://muninndb.com/install.ps1 | iex

# 2. Start (first-run setup is automatic)
muninn start
```

```bash
# 3. Store a memory
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/engrams \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"concept":"payment incident","content":"We switched to idempotency keys after the double-charge incident in Q3"}'

# 4. Ask what is relevant RIGHT NOW
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/activate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"context":["debugging the payment retry logic"]}'
```

That Q3 incident surfaces. You never mentioned it. MuninnDB connected the concepts.

**Web UI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8476` · **Admin:** `root` / `password` (change after first login)

## Connect Your AI Tools

MuninnDB auto-detects and configures Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw, Windsurf, OpenCode, VS Code, and others:

```bash
muninn init
```

Follow the prompts. Done. Your AI tools now have persistent, cognitive memory.

**Manual MCP configuration** — if you prefer to configure by hand:

<details>
<summary>Claude Desktop</summary>

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninn": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `"type"` is intentionally omitted. Claude Desktop v1.1.4010+ crashes on startup if `"type": "http"` is present in any `mcpServers` entry — the transport is inferred from the URL.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code / CLI</summary>

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cursor</summary>

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>OpenClaw</summary>

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninn": {
      "command": "muninn",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

OpenClaw uses stdio transport. The `muninn mcp` proxy (included in the binary) handles bearer token auth automatically — no credential needed in the config file.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windsurf</summary>

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>VS Code</summary>

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>OpenCode</summary>

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%APPDATA%\opencode\opencode.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp",
      "oauth": false,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {file:~/.muninn/mcp.token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Omit the `headers` block if you are running MuninnDB without token authentication.

> **Note:** OpenCode tools are exposed as `muninn_muninn_remember`, `muninn_muninn_recall`, etc. (server key + tool name prefix). Users preferring shorter names can register the server under the key `memory` instead, which yields `memory_muninn_remember`, `memory_muninn_recall`, etc.
</details>

<details>
<summary>GitHub Copilot</summary>

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN` with the token from your `muninn.env` file. Omit the `headers` block if running without token auth. If Copilot shows an OAuth error, the `headers` block is missing — adding it resolves it. [Full Copilot setup guide →](docs/integrations/github-copilot.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Codebuff</summary>

Add to your Codebuff MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "muninn": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For proactive memory behavior — Codebuff storing useful discoveries without being asked — add the memory instructions to your `AGENT.md`. [Full Codebuff setup guide →](docs/integrations/codebuff.md)
</details>

MuninnDB exposes **35 MCP tools** — store, activate, search, batch insert, get usage guidance, manage vaults, and more. On first connect, call `muninn_guide` for vault-aware instructions. No token required against the default vault. [Full MCP reference →](https://muninndb.com/docs)

## What Just Happened

Most databases store data and wait. MuninnDB stores *memory traces* — called **engrams** — and continuously works on them in the background. When you called `activate`, it ran a 6-phase pipeline: parallel full-text + vector search, fused the results, applied Hebbian co-activation boosts from past queries, injected predictive candidates from sequential patterns, traversed the association graph, and scored everything with ACT-R temporal weighting — in under 20ms.

The Q3 incident surfaced because MuninnDB understood that *"payment retry logic"* and *"idempotency keys after a double-charge"* are part of the same conversation. You never wrote that relationship. It emerged from semantic proximity and how these concepts travel together. That is the difference between a database and memory.

[Deep dive: How Memory Works →](docs/how-memory-works.md)

---

## Why MuninnDB

- **Temporal priority** — the database continuously recalculates what matters based on how recently and how often you've accessed each memory. Memories you use stay sharp. Memories you ignore fade naturally. The database moves while you sleep.
- **Hebbian learning** — memories activated together automatically form associations. Edges strengthen with co-activation, fade when the pattern stops. You never define a schema of relationships.
- **Predictive activation** — the database tracks sequential patterns across activations and learns to surface the *next* memory before you ask for it. Recall@10 improves 21% in workflow-oriented use cases.
- **Semantic triggers** — subscribe to a context. The database pushes when something becomes relevant — not because you queried, but because *relevance changed*. No polling. No cron. The DB initiates.
- **Bayesian confidence** — every engram tracks how sure MuninnDB is. Reinforcing memories raise confidence; contradictions lower it. Grounded in evidence, not a label you assign.
- **Plug-and-play AI onboarding** — call `muninn_guide` and the database tells your AI exactly how to use memory, customized to the vault's configuration. No manual prompt engineering.
- **Retroactive enrichment** — add the embed or enrich plugin and every existing memory upgrades automatically in the background. No migration. No code change. The database improves what it already holds.
- **Bulk insert** — batch up to 50 memories in a single call across all protocols (REST, gRPC, MCP). Efficient for data seeding, migration, and high-throughput agents.
- **Four protocols** — MBP (binary, <10ms ACK), REST (JSON), gRPC (protobuf), MCP (AI agents). Pick your stack; they all hit the same cognitive engine.
- **Single binary** — no Redis, no Kafka, no Postgres dependency. One process. One install command. Runs on a MacBook or a 3-node cluster.

## Examples

**REST — the full cycle:**

```bash
# Write
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/engrams \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "concept": "auth architecture",
    "content": "Short-lived JWTs (15min), refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies, sessions server-side in Redis",
    "tags": ["auth", "security"]
  }'

# Activate by context (returns ranked, time-weighted, associated memories)
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/activate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"context": ["reviewing the login flow for the mobile app"], "max_results": 5}'

# Search by text
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/engrams?q=JWT&vault=default'
```

**Python SDK:**

```python
from muninn import MuninnClient

async with MuninnClient("http://127.0.0.1:8475") as m:
    # Store
    await m.write(vault="default", concept="auth architecture",
                  content="Short-lived JWTs, refresh in HttpOnly cookies")

    # Activate — context-aware, ranked, cognitively weighted
    result = await m.activate(vault="default",
                              context=["reviewing the login flow"],
                              max_results=5)
    for item in result.activations:
        print(f"{item.concept}  score={item.score:.3f}")
```

```bash
pip install muninn-python
```

**LangChain integration:**

```python
from muninn.langchain import MuninnDBMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

memory = MuninnDBMemory(vault="my-agent")
chain = ConversationChain(llm=your_llm, memory=memory)
# Every turn is stored. Every response draws on relevant past context.
```

**Go SDK:**

```go
import "github.com/scrypster/muninndb/sdk/go/muninn"

client := muninn.NewClient("http://127.0.0.1:8475", "your-api-key")
id, _ := client.Write(ctx, "default", "auth architecture",
    "Short-lived JWTs, refresh in HttpOnly cookies", []string{"auth"})
resp, _ := client.Activate(ctx, "default", []string{"login flow"}, 5)
```

```bash
go get github.com/scrypster/muninndb/sdk/go/muninn
```

**Node.js / TypeScript SDK:**

```typescript
import { MuninnClient } from '@muninndb/client';

const client = new MuninnClient({ token: 'your-api-key' });
const { id } = await client.write({ concept: 'auth architecture',
    content: 'Short-lived JWTs, refresh in HttpOnly cookies' });
const result = await client.activate({ context: ['login flow'] });
```

```bash
npm install @muninndb/client
```

**PHP SDK:**

```php
use MuninnDB\MuninnClient;

$client = new MuninnClient(token: 'your-api-key');
$result = $client->write(concept: 'auth architecture',
    content: 'Short-lived JWTs, refresh in HttpOnly cookies');
$memories = $client->activate(context: ['login flow']);
```

```bash
composer require muninndb/client
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>MCP connection fails with schema validation error</summary>

MuninnDB speaks both `http` and `sse` MCP transports — the server handles either. The `"type"` field in your config must match what your client expects:

- **Claude Desktop v1.1.4010+**: omit `"type"` entirely — the transport is inferred from the URL. Adding `"type": "http"` crashes Claude Desktop on startup.
- **Most other tools** (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.): `"type": "http"` is correct.
- **Older clients** (Claude Code before v2.1.53): use `"type": "sse"`.

If your tool reports a schema validation or config parsing error, try removing `"type"` or switching between `"http"` and `"sse"`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>muninn_remember or muninn_recall hangs</summary>

Check that the server is running: `muninn status`. If the server is running but tools hang, check `muninn logs` for errors. The most common cause is a stale MCP config pointing to the wrong port — verify the URL in your config matches `http://127.0.0.1:8750/mcp`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>muninn: command not found</summary>

The binary must be in your `PATH`. On macOS/Linux, the default install location is `~/.local/bin/muninn` — run `echo $PATH` to verify it includes `~/.local/bin`. If not, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` and restart your shell. On Windows, the default is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\muninn` — run `$env:PATH` in PowerShell to verify.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows: DLL or ORT initialization error on first start</summary>

The bundled local embedder uses ONNX Runtime, which requires the Visual C++ Redistributable on Windows. Most machines already have it. If you see an error about `onnxruntime.dll` or "ORT environment init", install the [Visual C++ 2019+ Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and restart muninn.
