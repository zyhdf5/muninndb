"""SDK assertion-based smoke tests.

These tests run against a LIVE MuninnDB server. They are NOT unit tests — they
require a running server and will fail with a connection error if one is not
available. This is intentional: the purpose is to catch regressions in the SDK
or server before they ship.

Configure the server address with environment variables:
    MUNINNDB_URL   — base URL (default: http://localhost:8476)
    MUNINNDB_TOKEN — bearer token (default: None / no auth)

Note: tests use the "default" vault which is pre-configured as public.
Other vault names require an API key for GET requests (vault is read from
?vault= query param by auth middleware, not from the request body).

Run:
    PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_sdk_smoke.py -v
